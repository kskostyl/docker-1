# A  group of zergs is attacking orbital-command, and shutting down
# the engineering-bay service wonâ€™t help at all... You must send a troup of 
# Marines to eliminate the intruders. Launch a 42school/marine-squad in two 
# replicas, and make sure that the service works properly (see the documentation
# provided at hub.docker.com). This service will be named... marines and will 
# be on the overmind network.
# We ensure that we attach the overmind network, right name, set the correct
# number of replicas (2, one for node Aiur and one for node Char). We have
# to use the orbital-command passwords we used when we set the rabbitmq
# service.
# Make sure that the service is working by running -> docker service ps marines or docker service logs --follow marines
#

docker service create --network=overmind --name=marines --replicas=2 --env OC_USERNAME=ksenia --env OC_PASSWD=1234 42school/marine-squad:latest
